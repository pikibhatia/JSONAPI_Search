Automate the application URL testing and trigger the mail on test results to the team. Sometimes the application web URLs fails to work. Until the end users comeback saying URLs are not working or if it is tested by the development/Test team for unit testing, the development/Test team will not get to know that the URLs are not working.

National Grid is asking us to remove them from this process whereby IBM will be required to monitor the ServiceNow tracking queue and calling-out the appropriate IBM staff when a priority 1 or 2 incident event occurs.

Historically the processor has been in the UK, but the RMA business now requires a business model such that the vendor and processor can be in any EU market, e.g. Slovakia. Where the raw material processor is in Slovakia, because Jaguar Land Rover Limited has a Slovakian VAT registration, EU VAT law requires that the purchase from the vendor to be recorded on the SK VAT return and EC Sales List and that the purchase invoices are issue against/on Jaguar Land Rover Limiteds SK VAT registration. The GB29 company code is the organisational unit that represents Jaguar Land Rover Limiteds SK VAT registration and therefore in order to meet the required reporting obligations, the RMA solution must be extended to GB29. RMA was originally scoped for UK based only and any extension into Europe was contingent on a new BRD. As current functionality does not facilitate the offsetting of receivables and payables ledgers across different company codes a change is required. If an automated solution is not available, there will be a need for additional resource to manually block all payable transaction on the specific vendor accounts, validation of receivables position before manually offsetting or releasing transactions for payment. Delivery of the BRD removes the need for the additional GFS resource.

In case there are 2 different tasks with the same date, Robot is using the task type as additional criterion: higher priority for tasks from the sheet \u00e2\u20ac\u0153FPV creation\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, lower priority for the tasks \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Parameter recalculation\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, the lowest priority for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Component change\u00e2\u20ac\u009d). Basically, each task is a separate sub-process for the robot to follow: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 FPV creation: create BOM (Bill of material) alternatives for FA Codes. It is done by filtering BOM components and calculating parameters, \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Parameter recalculation: press \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Calculate & check\u00e2\u20ac\u009d to trigger recalculation done automatically in the background in PLM \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Item replacement: replace BOM component by unticking \u00e2\u20ac\u0153old\u00e2\u20ac\u009d item and ticking \u00e2\u20ac\u0153new\u00e2\u20ac\u009d item in the BOM alternative Upon finishing the tasks, Robot creates column in each tab of the trigger Excel file called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Comments\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and will store the status/agreed information for Spec Office Team there. Once all BOMs are created/updated for an FA code, data (CL) is sent for approval which is done by the Panoramix Robot already created by RPA Team.\r\n\r\nBUSINESS BENEFITS: \r\nWIP - Transition to IBM in progress - Please Reach out to Contact Person for Benefit Details", "ClientName": "APD-163-Consumer Product Retail-Operations-Localiz", "SolutionTypeId": 0, "SolutionType": null, "GeographyId": 2, "Geography": "Europe", "IndustryId": 6, "Industry": "Consumer Industry", "PublishersName": "SATYA N DHANEKULA", "PublishersEmailAddress": "sdhanekula@in.ibm.com", "Updated": "22/00/2020", "MarketplaceLinkToSolution": null, "BenefitTypeId": 0, "BenefitType": null, "StrategicTechnologyId": 0, "StrategicTechnology": null, "EnterpriseApplicationsId": 0, "EnterpriseApplication": null, "PrimaryTechnologiesInvolvedId": 6, "PrimaryTechnologiesInvolved": "Blue Prism", "DomainsProcessesId": 2, "DomainsProcesses": "Unknown\r\n", "IBMConfidentialId": 0, "IBMConfidential": null, "CodeLocation": null, "BoxLocation": null, "Metatags": "Web Applications", "Ratings": 0, "Created": "22/00/2020"}, {"ID": 7008, "SolutionTitle": "MRP Update", "SolutionDescription": "Every year thousands of technical materials are updated by TMM Specialists from European plants.

If you are trying to tune a bad performance query, or analyze a complex script while moving from one SQL dialect to another; you will need to extract the main components of the query and to do so specially for complex queries it would be a challenge, for that we developed our SQL parser tool using Java custome code to parse SQL queries of different complexities and generate the output in a readable csv format. The input query is transformed into XML - using GSP library- then the parser traverses the produced xml tree recursively to extract; (1) the table names in each level, (2) the transformation rules used to calculate the \u201cselect clause\u201d attributes in main queries taking in consideration the logic embeded in all subqueries till it reaches the root sub query, despite how deep the subqueries\u2019 hierarchy is, (3) It also extracts and transform the \"where conditions\" for the main query and subqueries as well.\n\nKey Features:\nThe SQL parsing asset is used to parse ANSI SQL queries and Oracle specific SQL queries (PL SQL).\nThe tool parses all files in an input folder at once regardless of the number of files or the queries within each file, the output from each file can be identified via unique identification keys for each query with in each file.\nNo limitation to a specific number of subqueries, inner queries, or query hierarchies as It decodes different levels of subqueries as a tree.\nBeside parsing \u201cSelect clause\u201d, the tool also parses \u201cCTAS statement (Create Table As Select)\u201d and \u201cinsert into select\u201d statements.\nThe tool uses DB Catalog as a reference to resolve \u201cunion & select *\u201d statements efficiently. DB Catalog is generated from DB and includes a list of table names, attribute names, data types, and column order within the table.\nIn case DB catalog is not available, high tolerance option will be checked to parse the queries without the need for a catalog, however queries with \u201cselect *\u201d will fail to parse.\nThe tool can Parse complex clauses such as WITH, RANK, & PARTITION BY\nThe tool provides a separate file for the corrupted input SQL queries in case they are not in a runnable state.\n\nKey Benefits:\nParse any runnable SQL apart from its complexity and present it in a standardized format facilitating the queries\u2019 analysis and saving the alternate manual analysis effort & time.\nProvide a comprehensive view of technical rules in different subqueries\u2019 levels dynamically by fetching all subqueries\u2019 hierarchies level taking advantage of recursion mechanism.

I have implemented a generic DB model to hold all the rejected records from any source stream and load it into one table with 2 standard columns, first column will hold concatenated column names and the other one will contain the column values and in both columns the delimiter would be \u201c;\u201d, however I had a challenge to list the column names from the different input streams using the DataStage tool which I are using to handle the data movement because each table has its own structure which varies from others with respect to column names and datatypes and there are no built-in function to do so in DataStage, also for the column values I had to do manual work for all the input columns. The asset that I developed comes to picture, it\u2019s a java component to be called within any DataStage job with any number of columns as input no matter how they are structured or how many they are, the output each time would be the same to match the unified rejection component by concatenating the column names and values without exerting effort in writing  down the column names or their values, doing that manually would have been a real pain for the project team to achieve and high risk for maintenance as if a new column is introduced, as it would require addition in the list manually.

Adding new columns, delimiter changes, \u2026, etc.).\n\nKey Features:\nThe asset is used as part of the rejection component which could be used for reprocessing and indicate the root cause of the issue from the source data that are not complying with the rules set in the ETL jobs\n\nThe code accepts any number of columns and generates only 2 columns with the following details:\n\n    COLUMNSNAMES : will contain list of all column names in order concatenated and separated by \";\"\n    COLUMNSVALUES : will contain list of all the values in the input columns in order concatenated and separated by \";\"\n\nKey Benefit:\n    * It fits any data projects and not industry specific\n    * It can be used to assure data quality during extraction process.\n    * Facilitate operations efforts by providing monitoring technique for all tables at one place\n    * Effort reduction during development, testing and maintenance.\n    * Asset will allow proper data governance for extracted & loaded data from different source & targets as it monitors the rejection in one place\n    * Internal ETL audit purposes to guarantee data movement from source to destination (any source or destination format (file, or DBMS table, or ...etc.) with proper quality and adhering to the required business rules.\n    * No need to exert dedicated effort to log each record separately in the jobs", "ClientName": "Others - CBDS", "SolutionTypeId": 0, "SolutionType": null, "GeographyId": 3, "Geography": "Middle East & Africa", "IndustryId": 25, "Industry": "Not Industry Specific ", "PublishersName": "Othman Abdelbaset/Egypt/IBM", "PublishersEmailAddress": "othman.abdelbaset@ibm.com", "Updated": "23/01/2022", "MarketplaceLinkToSolution": null, "BenefitTypeId": 0, "BenefitType": null, "StrategicTechnologyId": 0, "StrategicTechnology": null, "EnterpriseApplicationsId": 0, "EnterpriseApplication": null, "PrimaryTechnologiesInvolvedId": 4, "PrimaryTechnologiesInvolved": "Script", "DomainsProcessesId": 1, "DomainsProcesses": "Information Technology", "IBMConfidentialId": 0, "IBMConfidential": null, "CodeLocation": null, "BoxLocation": null, "Metatags": "concat,datastage,java", "Ratings": 0, "Created": "23/01/2022"}, {"ID": 9668, "SolutionTitle": "Simple tool to backup all SSRS reports from the instance", "SolutionDescription": "This asset will be very helpful for the SSRS developers in MSBI projects for taking ad-hoc backups of their reports to safeguard their developments in case of a disaster.

For full usage guidelines refer to http://ibm.biz/innersourcing-consume-guidelines and the LICENSE file in this repository.\n\nKey Features:\nTopic modelling uncovers semantic patterns in data by grouping co-occuring words together into topics. Words within a topic are weighted to show the relative importance of words within a topic. This asset not only performs topic modelling using LDA but also expands it by providing a classification framework to map input text to the topics discovered in the dataset. Many text preprocessing tasks are also supported. Potential use cases: 1) Move beyond simple word counts to build topic word clouds and illustrate semantic patterns in text data 2) Augment annotator dictionaries using topic modelling to capture how words are used in your dataset, rather than trying to come up with dictionaries on your own 3) Classify text data into topics, capture topic trends over time\n\nKey benefits:\n\nThe process to generating a topic model is automated, so all you need to provide is the data in a Python iterable format -- this can be as simple as a list or a column in a DataFrame, or as complex as a user-defined class.

The solution combines three primary technologies - IBM Watson, UneeQ and data from TransUnion - to bring to life a personal assistant for case workers that starts to take on some of the paper work and the updating of systems of record, as well as helping case workers focus on what is important by providing pro-active alerts for key events.", "ClientName": "N/A", "SolutionTypeId": 0, "SolutionType":
